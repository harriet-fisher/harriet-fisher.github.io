            <h1>Decomposure: 3D Video Game</h1>
            <h2>Tools: Unity, C#, Blender</h2>
            <h2>Role: Software Developer, Creative Designer</h2>
            <p>Decomposure is a unique apocalyptic organization game where players must navigate their survival within a confined, industrial room, relying on object-based text prompts to learn about their world. As apocalyptic events unfold, players face the dilemma of deciding which items to preserve and which to sacrifice. The game’s narrative is revealed through the exploration of the room and its objects, with large-scale disasters manifesting subtly through effects like window flashes, sounds, and camera shakes. This design choice emphasizes the gradual erosion of normalcy and highlights how trauma often accumulates through small, persistent disruptions rather than a single cataclysmic event. The game fosters a feeling of isolation and disconnect from the outside world, subverting the typical survival-focused narrative of apocalyptic games by centering around seemingly trivial personal items and their narratives.</p>
