            <h1>Digital Metamorphosis</h1>
            <h2>Tools: Blender, ZBrush, Unity</h2>
            <h2>Role: 3D Designer</h2>
            <p>These pieces explore the complex relationship between digital interactions and identity, bodies, and personhood, both online and offline. These works take inspiration from various, actual online messages I've received, which I obtained through downloading my personal Instagram data.</p>
            <p>Through a series of 3D characters, the project depicts different thematic occurrences in internet interactions. The characters are based on five themes: (Un)Natural Beauty, Masochism, Maternity, Commodification, and Anger. Each character embodies the different ways in which digital interactions affect our digital citizenship and perceptions and shape our understanding of ourselves and our bodies. Through these depictions, the project aims to provoke thought and discussion around the impact of our digital interactions on our sense of selves and personhood.</p>
            <p>This work was exhibited in an immersive virtual art gallery</p>

            <h1>The Lapse: Independent Feature Film</h1>
            <h2>Role: Producer</h2>
            <p>The Lapse is a compelling, independent film that follows Maxine, a character whose grip on reality begins to unravel following a harrowing relapse. Our director and writers crafted a narrative that delves into the dissolution of reality, exploring how identity, addiction, and relationships intersect in complex and disorienting ways. Through Maxine’s journey, the film navigates the murky waters of perception versus reality, compelling audiences to question what they see and feel. My role in production involved careful management of both the artistic and logistical elements to ensure the film authentically represented these themes and conveyed our story. I coordinated with a dedicated cast and crew, secured funding, and managed our team to ensure that Maxine’s story resonated, offering a unique lens on the challenges faced by those grappling with their own realities.</p>

            <h2>Role: Technical Project Manager</h2>
            <p>Entanglement (working title) is a collaboration between STAGE and Assistant Professor Tian Zhong to develop a new theatre project about quantum entanglement. STAGE has been working with physicists, game designers, motion capture and mixed reality experts, martial and performing artists, along with UChicago faculty, postdocs, grad students, and undergrads to activate their quantum imagination. The multimedia play is set to debut in Winter 2024. Some of my tasks at STAGE are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>3D Asset Creation: Design and develop 3D models and environments for integration into theatre productions.</li>
                <li>Website Design and Maintenance: Oversee the design, development, and regular updating of the lab’s website to ensure it remains functional and visually appealing.</li>
                <li>Isadora Software Management: Utilize Isadora software for real-time multimedia manipulation, enhancing live performances through interactive visuals.</li>
                <li>Projection Mapping: Implement projection mapping techniques to cast intricate light and image displays onto 3D surfaces, enriching the visual experience of productions.</li>
                <li>Multimedia Coordination: Coordinate the integration of various multimedia elements (audio, video, lighting) to ensure cohesive execution during performances.</li>
                <li>Technical Troubleshooting: Address and resolve technical issues that arise during production</li>
