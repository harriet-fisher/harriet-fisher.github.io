            <h1>Digital Metamorphosis</h1>
            <h2>Tools: Blender, ZBrush, Unity</h2>
            <h2>Role: 3D Designer</h2>
            <p>These pieces explore the complex relationship between digital interactions and identity, bodies, and personhood, both online and offline. These works take inspiration from various, actual online messages I've received, which I obtained through downloading my personal Instagram data.</p>
            <p>Through a series of 3D characters, the project depicts different thematic occurrences in internet interactions. The characters are based on five themes: (Un)Natural Beauty, Masochism, Maternity, Commodification, and Anger. Each character embodies the different ways in which digital interactions affect our digital citizenship and perceptions and shape our understanding of ourselves and our bodies. Through these depictions, the project aims to provoke thought and discussion around the impact of our digital interactions on our sense of selves and personhood.</p>
            <p>This work was exhibited in an immersive virtual art gallery</p>

            <h2>Role: Technical Project Manager</h2>
            <p>Entanglement (working title) is a collaboration between STAGE and Assistant Professor Tian Zhong to develop a new theatre project about quantum entanglement. STAGE has been working with physicists, game designers, motion capture and mixed reality experts, martial and performing artists, along with UChicago faculty, postdocs, grad students, and undergrads to activate their quantum imagination. The multimedia play is set to debut in Winter 2024. Some of my tasks at STAGE are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>3D Asset Creation: Design and develop 3D models and environments for integration into theatre productions.</li>
                <li>Website Design and Maintenance: Oversee the design, development, and regular updating of the labâ€™s website to ensure it remains functional and visually appealing.</li>
                <li>Isadora Software Management: Utilize Isadora software for real-time multimedia manipulation, enhancing live performances through interactive visuals.</li>
                <li>Projection Mapping: Implement projection mapping techniques to cast intricate light and image displays onto 3D surfaces, enriching the visual experience of productions.</li>
                <li>Multimedia Coordination: Coordinate the integration of various multimedia elements (audio, video, lighting) to ensure cohesive execution during performances.</li>
                <li>Technical Troubleshooting: Address and resolve technical issues that arise during production</li>

            <h2>Tools: Ruby, Java, Adobe CC</h2>
            <h2>Role: Software Developer, Creative Designer</h2>
            <p>Polaris is a crowd-sourced crime tracking app designed to enhance personal safety and community awareness. Developed using Ruby and Java, Polaris provides real-time crime data and safety features to help users navigate their environments more securely. Key features of the app include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Path Optimization: Leverage real-time crime data to suggest the safest routes, helping users avoid areas with ongoing or recent criminal activity.</li>
                <li>Crime Filtering: Users can filter crime reports by type, such as theft, assault, or vandalism, to get detailed information relevant to their concerns.</li>
                <li>User Reporting: Empower the community by allowing users to report crimes and suspicious activities directly through the app, contributing to a comprehensive crime database.</li>
                <li>Emergency Contact Alerts: In case of emergencies, users can send alerts to their pre-set emergency contacts, including their current location information, ensuring timely assistance.</li>

            <h1>SVD Image Compressor</h1>
            <h2>Tools: Python, Numpy, Pillow</h2>
            <h2>Role: Programmer</h2>
            <p>The SVD Image Compressor leverages Singular Value Decomposition to efficiently compress images, optimizing file sizes while maintaining high image quality. This tool can be beneficial for web developers, photographers, and anyone managing large digital image libraries because it offers significant reductions in storage. By providing an intuitive interface and adjustable compression levels, the compressor ensures that users can easily balance between quality and compression.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>SVD-Based Compression: Decomposes images into singular values to efficiently reduce file size while preserving critical details.</li>
                <li>
                    Customizable Compression Levels: Allows users to choose the compression ratio, enabling a balance between image quality and file size.</li>
                <li>
                    Graphical Outputs: Generates graphs showing singular values, relative error, and rank of approximation, aiding in visual analysis of compression effectiveness.</li>
